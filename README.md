# Crop-Disease
Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of plant images, focusing on distinguishing between healthy and diseased plants. Utilizing the "New Plant Diseases Dataset" with augmentation, we employ Matplotlib and Keras libraries for image processing and neural network construction.

The CNN architecture is established using a Sequential model, incorporating convolutional layers, batch normalization, max-pooling, dropout, and dense layers. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical crossentropy loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
